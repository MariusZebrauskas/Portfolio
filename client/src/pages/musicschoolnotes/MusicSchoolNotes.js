      <h1>Full Stack Aplication</h1>
      <i>
        I`m the only developer who worked on this project, every line of code was written on my own.
        Using pictures of albums I designed the website on the fly.
      </i>
      <p>
        This application is designed to sell music note sheets to piano teachers around the world. I
        integrated 3 languages into this website: Lithuanian, Russian, English. You can pick them up
        on the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this website at the moment are uploaded 3 albums. You can pick the album you want to look
        upon on this menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, there is a playlist (draggable with the mouse), you can listen to all music songs
        without having an account created, but if you decide to buy a music note sheet of a song you
        listened to or a full album, then you need to register and use your account to put that item
        in the cart.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Here is a login page, there are some pages where login is required, in this case, please
          use test account, or register a new one.
