        <h1>Short Intro</h1>
        <p>
          First of all I`m the only developer who worked on this project, every line of code was
          written on my own. Using pictures of albums I designed the website design on the fly.
        </p>
        <p>A person I was warking on, was a Piano teacher, she allready had 3 music albums</p>
        <p>My task was to make a way to sell those albums online in elegant way</p>
        <p>That is how this website came to life</p>
        <h1>About Website</h1>
        <p>
          On this website you can listen music clips for free, if you happy with a music peace you
          can add music notes to cart
        </p>
        <p>Once you finish shoping, with stripe help you can pay for your shoping items</p>
        <p>After shoping is compleate, you receive sheets allmost instantly to your email</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Because this application is designed to sell music note sheets to piano teachers around the
        world. I integrated 3 languages into this website: Lithuanian, Russian, English. You can
        pick them up on the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this website at the moment are uploaded 3 albums. You can pick the album you want to look
        upon on this menu.
